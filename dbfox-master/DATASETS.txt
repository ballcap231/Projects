Each of the datasets are connected by the Bill ID field, which are only unique 
for the first two tables and will be the primary key for those two. For the 
latter two tables, there are serial IDs given by Enigma, which will serve as 
their primary key. The Bill ID field for the latter two will be the foreign key 
referencing the primary keys of the first two.

For drawing conclusions, we will focus on the results of the bills, whether they 
passed or failed. We hope to relate these to market data, analyzing the effects 
of the market on whether or not a bill is passed through the house and senate.
