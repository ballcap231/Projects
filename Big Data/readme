Projects done for Big data for health applications

A research paper is also included of results from BERT performance on clinical documents for multi-label classification. 
A pre-trained BERT model was fine-tuned to our MIMIC-III dataset and the performance was analyzed.

Hw 1: Predicted mortality using sklearn models such as SVM/Log Reg/Random Forest - python

Hw 2: Map-Reduced data for Log Reg prediction of mortality - Hadoop

Hw 3: Predicted patients disease states using supervised and unsupervised phenotyping methods (i.e. rule-based vs K-means/GMM) in Spark

Hw 4: Clustered patients in Spark Graphx to find similarities/dissimilarities

Hw 5: Built GRU/CNN/MLP models in pytorch to predict mortality in patients
